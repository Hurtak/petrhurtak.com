          #   `timeout`
          #     Increased because some links are on free Netlify or Heroku which can put the instances to sleep and it
          #     can take a long time for them to start again.
          #   `buffer-size`
          #     Increased otherwise it fails with "error when reading response headers: small read buffer".
          #   `exclude="https://www.linkedin.com"`
          #     Because LinkedIn returns 999 status code for bots.
