Declaration
	Function x () {}

Expression
	Var let const x = () => {}

Mention difference in scoping/hoisting
Const function cannot be overridden by mistake
	Only theoretical benefit, while when using const with variables you are giving it some semantic meaning to the future code reader, that this cariable doesent cahnge but this one does, when it comes to functions they are never overridden so not really benefit
Expression disadvantage
	Harder to differenciate in code, same syntax highlight as variables
	While declaration is hoisted to var x = function x () {}, expressions are variables with anonymous function,s this could lead to worse stack traces?? Or it led to worse stack traces in older browsers, find out
