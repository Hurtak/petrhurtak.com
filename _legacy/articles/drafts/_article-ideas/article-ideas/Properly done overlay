	Usual mistakes
		- overlay adds another scroll bar
		- Overlay allows scrolling of the content bellow - could be nice/useful- but if you need to see bellow you should not really use overlay
		- Removes scrollbar which will caouse layout recalculation / jumping - because suddenly viewport is 20px wider


	Some people dont even test web pages in
