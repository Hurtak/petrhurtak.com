Basically have a library to which you pass data & function
These things will be run in web worker
Returned thing will be promise

Example

const data = [1,2,3]
const fun = function (data) {
	return data.map(x => x * 2)
}

const result = await webWorkerLib(fun, data)



Measure the cose of transfering data
Compare performance to webworker files
Compare performance of js run in worker vs js run normally
