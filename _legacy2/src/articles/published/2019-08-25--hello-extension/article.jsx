    <P>
      I made a <Link href={storeLink}>Chrome extension</Link> that replaces your new tab with widgets and fresh image
      every day.
    </P>

    <P>
      The daily new image is from bing.com, in case you are offline there is dozen of nice wallpapers from nature that I
      liked.
    </P>

    <P>
      You can also display a widget in front. Some are traditional, like a clock, some are meant to motivate you a
      little.
