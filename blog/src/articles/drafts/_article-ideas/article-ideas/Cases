Identifiers
Identifiers come in three flavors in Dart.
	• UpperCamelCase names capitalize the first letter of each word, including the first.
	• lowerCamelCase names capitalize the first letter of each word, except the first which is always lowercase, even if it’s an acronym.
	• lowercase_with_underscores use only lowercase letters, even for acronyms, and separate words with _.
