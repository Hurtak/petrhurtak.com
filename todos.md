- General
  - write README.md
  - fine tune humans.txt
  - https://github.com/googlechrome/sw-precache
  - consider unification of quotes (html ", js ')
  - consider unification of coding style across technologies (camelCase JS, underscore_case MySQL, dash-case CSS)
  - take a look at ponyfoo.com for performance ideas
  - performance testing
    - https://css-tricks.com/use-webpagetest-api/
  - revisit package.json
  - progressively enhanced tweet quotations
  - enable brotli compression
    - https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/10/next-generation-server-compression-with-brotli/
  - tags to articles
  - consider using execa, shelljs, cash for scripts once async/await lands
  - projects page
  - use & write article about https://github.com/nolanlawson/optimize-js
  - consider taking a look at some HTML elements and putting them in components article and using them
    - dl (dt dd)
    - date
    - hr, something like medium?
    - kbd
    - q (quotes: none; or have our own quotes with ::after and ::before, if we would have our own quotes, add note into typography chapter of components article)
    - abbr (http://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/tryit.asp?filename=trybs_txt_abbr&stacked=h)
    - small
    - itemprop attribute
  - about page
  - add search with suggest box
  - add aria stuff and accessibility stuff, also add that accessibility menu when you press tab
  - link to github/twitter
  - investigate nginx and caddy https://caddyserver.com/
  - https://securityheaders.io/
    - also article about this
  - check if we are not using sync (readFileSync) functions anywhere
  - cron job to test
    - https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/cron-jobs/
    - automatically git fetch changes and update new articles
  - think of how to unify scripts between package.json, scripts/ and .travis.yml
  - think of a ways how to unify debug mode with production mode
  - check for TODOs in code and resolve them
  - also unify /rss and /about routes to have trailing slash?
- code snippet tool
  - add bigger snippets where we can display html & css & js next to each other (on bigger screen widths)
  - in config
    - have a way to disable some controls / hide some tabs that are not necessary
    - have a way to set height of snippet (probably in config?)
  - add variaous layers of validation, like that when snippets dir exists, there is at least on .html file in there
  - be able to resize
  - Source link doesent align with button - http://i.imgur.com/AIKK2K2.png (only in chrome)
  - json schema for metadata.yaml validation?
  - have a way to display diffs
  - inspiration: https://jakearchibald.com/2016/svg-media-queries/
  - also have a way to put code in page for people just to play with, not to take a look how it was done? like lorem ipsum generator would be the type of snippet which would be just used instead of inspected how it was done. On the other hand, some CSS layout example would be useful to have easily available button to show what is the html / css, and also way to resize
  - have a way to display example fullscreen like kod.jecas.cz?
  - chapter about this into components
  - With each code live snippet have a warning if some feature is not supported in current browser
  - With snippets display what language they are from and maybe even version (with elm for example)
  - have unified way to display feature support
  - have borderless mode where we just display the content
  - parsing
    - have some more robust way how to parse -> split -> save -> reconnect snippet html
    - maybe have customizable doctype?
  - have certain properties customizable like here
    - http://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/pbVdPx/
  - have a way to add http header to the document response
    - probably by adding some html comment in snippet html
      - add html comment (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/941100/can-comments-appear-before-the-doctype-declaration)
      - probably in yaml?
      - parse that and save into database
      - when serving this file add relevant headers
      - do not add any other extra headers like powered by and security headers added by helmet??
        - somebody could then display our content? maybe only add the one which disables displaying in iframe?
      - also keep the original headers comment in html so reader can easily see what headers were added?
- Articles
  - currently html of code blocks is parsed and we cannot get raw html? so `<h2>` will become `<h2></h2>`, maybe switch to jsdom?
  - add gradient overlay on code blocks that overflow to y
  - in parseArticle function have functions which checks article for correctness
    - check if paragraphs start with capital letter and end with dot
    - check of headings start with capital letter
    - check YAML header for correctness
    - check that all relative url's start with `./` (or do not start with)
    - maybe refactor this into separate module?
    - maybe when checking html, when we find error -> add console.log describing the error
  - post all articles to hacker news, reddit, twitter
    - provide links under article to hacker news and twitter discussion
      - http://i.imgur.com/XIfTwcz.png (from http://jlongster.com)
    - have these links saved in front matter
    - have cron job which determines number of comments on giver articles
    - display number of comments under
  - do not compile articles manually with script, compile them on the fly when requested
    - measure how long this takes
    - if it takes > 5ms, wrap the whole thing in caching function which will just save the result into file
  - add checks in upload script so it checks if
    - url's are unique
    - id's are unique
    - directory month/year fits the publication date directories
  - flatten directory structure, just use years directories
  - add rel="noopener" to links to other domains
    - https://jakearchibald.com/2016/performance-benefits-of-rel-noopener/
    - write article about this
  - refactor styles
  - add article footer with
    - share on twitter and facebook
    - edit this article on github
      - or maybe what could be really cool would be if there was live edit and anyone could submit edit
    - similar articles and next article
  - refactor upload script, put id into articles so we have truly unique identificator?
  - parse article function uses readFileSync, rewrite to use promises/cb
  - replace @see links in code with my own articles
- Frontend
  - http://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html#whitespace-control

  - have all relevant metatags, inspire with jecas.cz and ponyfoo.com
  - console easter egg, or perhaps something inside HTML? http://codepen.io/elijahmanor/pen/RPjeLz?editors=001
  - consider switching to async templating engine with streaing support (markojs by ebay, dustjs by linkedin)
