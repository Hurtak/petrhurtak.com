  - projects page
  - use & write article about https://github.com/nolanlawson/optimize-js

    - dl (dt dd)
    - date

    - have a way to disable some controls / hide some tabs that are not necessary

      - parse that and save into database
      - when serving this file add relevant headers
      - do not add any other extra headers like powered by and security headers added by helmet??
        - somebody could then display our content? maybe only add the one which disables displaying in iframe?
      - also keep the original headers comment in html so reader can easily see what headers were added?
